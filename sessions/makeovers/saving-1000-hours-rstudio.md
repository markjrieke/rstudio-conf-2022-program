<!-- ABSTRACT ----
Please write abstract below. You may use simple markdown (links, code style, bold, italics)

There are many benefits to using R and no lack of packages that help you solve technical difficulties, but you may still get stuck at selling it to decision-makers or implementing it at work. Tiger's recommendation is to start a project that focuses on automating work with R and gets everyone involved. Once the value of R has been established, selecting RStudio Workbench and RStudio Connect for streamlining tasks would not be a difficult choice. 

Several years ago, Tiger's organization moved away from SAS in favor of R for modeling projects, but there wasnâ€™t much initiative taken company-wide to move everything to a new tool. To help change that, he started a work automation project using R that has saved 12K+ hours of manual work. 

In this talk, he will share the key parts of the project, lessons learned, and a structure you can follow if you would like to do something similar in your organization.
