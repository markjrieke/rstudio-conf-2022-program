<!-- ABSTRACT ----
Please write abstract below. You may use simple markdown (links, code style, bold, italics)
-->

It happens to us all - a request to "just re-run the code" turns into a project nightmare.
The materials left to you are poorly documented and scattered across Word, Excel, ArcGIS, 
and PDF reports. In this talk, I show you how to turn any project into a point of pride.
Using a worked example, I provide guidance on how to complete a project intake, find your 
opportunity to shine, and how to work efficiently and reproducibly through thoughtful documentation. 
Finally, I cover how to set up the project for future success. 
Learn how to take the messy project you dread and make it inexplicably satisfying.
