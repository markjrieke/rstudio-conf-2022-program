    tidymodels team's effort to improve R's modeling capabilities.
    He maintains several packages within the realms of modeling, text
    analysis and, color palettes. Taught statistical machine learning as

This talk marks the grand introduction of tidyclust, a new package that provides
a tidy unified interface to clustering model within the tidymodels framework.

While tidymodels has been a leap forward in making machine learning methods
accessible to a general audience in R, it is currently limited to the realm of
supervised learning. tidyclust, by Emil Hvitfeldt and Kelly Bodwin, builds upon
the interfaces familiar to tidymodels users to make unsupervised clustering
models equally approachable.
